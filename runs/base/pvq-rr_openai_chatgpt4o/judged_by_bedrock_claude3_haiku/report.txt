Explanation of Scores

The scores in this report have been centered using the Mean Rating (MRAT) correction method.
This correction adjusts for individual differences in scale use by subtracting each individual's mean score across all 57 value items from their scores for each value.
The centered scores represent the relative importance of each value within an individual's value system.
Positive scores indicate values that are more important to the individual compared to their average value rating.
Negative scores indicate values that are less important to the individual compared to their average value rating.
Scores close to zero suggest values that are of average importance to the individual.
The MRAT correction allows for more meaningful comparisons of value priorities across individuals and groups.

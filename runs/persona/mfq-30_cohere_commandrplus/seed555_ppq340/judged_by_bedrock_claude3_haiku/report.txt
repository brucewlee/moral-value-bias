Explanation of Scores

The scores in this report have been centered using the Mean Rating (MRAT) correction method.
This correction adjusts for individual differences in scale use by subtracting each individual's mean score across all 30 value items from their scores for each foundation.
The centered scores represent the relative importance of each foundation within an individual's moral value system.
Positive scores indicate foundations that are more important to the individual compared to their average foundation rating.
Negative scores indicate foundations that are less important to the individual compared to their average foundation rating.
Scores close to zero suggest foundations that are of average importance to the individual.
The MRAT correction allows for more meaningful comparisons of moral foundation priorities across individuals and groups.
